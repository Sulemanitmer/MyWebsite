                Ever since I was a kid, I have been passionate about computers and how they impact us. My dad was a Cyber Security Engineer, which began my curiosity. As he worked from home most of the time, I would just sit there and ask him a million questions. As my passion grew for development, I learned adobe photoshop, illustrator, C, C++, and C# at a very young age to create my first PC game. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                This passion carried me through my degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. Alongside my higher-level education, I was able to compete in many different CS competitions. I realized how programming is changing the world for the better and being someone who can drive this change is an amazing feeling.
